<h1>Changelog</h1>
0.0.1 symbolizes 1 new implemented feature which works, but hasn't been tested to the full extent yet.<br>
0.1.0 symbolizes new version, but not tested yet, so there may be bugs, some inconsistencies and further changes.<br>
1.0.0 symbolizes well established version of the project, there are almost certainly no bugs and missing logic neither on the client or the server side.<br><br>

Version is going to shift from (0.1 -> 1.0), (0.2 -> 2.0) and so on whenever I feel the time has come.
