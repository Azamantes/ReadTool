# ReadTool
Tool made with reading and learning foreign languages in mind.<br>
I just made up the name so don't get too attached to it, it will probably change one day.

<p><b>My tools:</b></p>
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP (simple user authentication)
- Javascript, native browser Websockets
- Node.js
- MySQL database

<b>Library dependencies:</b><br>
JScolor - http://jscolor.com/<br>
Mithril - http://mithril.js.org/

<p><b>WHY?</b></p>
There is a project called "Learning with Texts" written few years ago by some guy. The idea was awesome but execution terrible. The application was (is?) very slow, lots of page reloading, heavy on PHP and AJAX, database data redundancy is unbelievable. I tried to use it for some time but it was just a pain. Waiting over a minute (!!!) for a page to load (list of titles). I know my PC wasn't that fast but come on.
In the end, I hadn't found any similar better app so I figured I had to do this on my own.

<p><b>Warning:</b></p>
There is almost <b>no security at all</b>. For now I'm focused on the functionality, so if you want to put it somewhere online, you better secure it well.

I am <b>not</b> going to support Internet Explorer.
I might support touchscreen devices, but only when the PC version is done.

<p><b>Goal:</b></p>
Create a lightning fast, easy-to-use tool, with very <b>minimalistic design</b> that will facilitate reading a text in a foreign language.
ReadTool is keeping its own translation data in the database so even without internet connection you can still review your previously read texts.
