# ReadTool

<p><b>WHY?</b></p>
There is a project called "Learning with Texts" written few years ago by some guy. The idea was awesome but execution terrible. The application was (is?) very slow, lots of page reloading, heavy on PHP and AJAX, database data redundancy is unbelievable. I tried to use it for some time but it was just a pain. Waiting over a minute (!!!) for a page to load (list of titles). I know my PC wasn't that fast but come on.
In the end, I hadn't found any similar better app so I figured I had to do this on my own.

<p><b>Goal:</b></p>
Create a lightning fast, easy-to-use tool, with very <b>minimalistic design</b> that will facilitate reading a text in a foreign language.
ReadTool is keeping its own translation data in the database so even without internet connection you can still review your previously read texts.

<p><b>My tools:</b></p>
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP (simple user authentication)
- Javascript, native browser Websockets
- Node.js
- MySQL database

<b>Library dependencies:</b><br>
